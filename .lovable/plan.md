# sakn's edits — Splash Screen Website

## Overview
A sleek, dark minimal website with an animated splash screen that transitions into a "Coming Soon" page, inspired by kenos.lol.

## Splash Screen
- **Dark background** with centered text "sakn's edits" in a clean, bold font
- **Blue accent color** on "sakn's" with "edits" in white
- **Wavy text reveal animation** — letters animate in with a staggered wave effect on page load
- Subtle background particle/grain texture for depth
- Splash screen lasts ~3 seconds

## Transition
- After the wave animation completes, the splash screen **fades out smoothly** into the main page

## Coming Soon Page
- Same dark minimal aesthetic
- "Coming Soon" text centered on screen
- Subtle animated gradient or pulse effect to keep it visually interesting
- Optional: social links or a simple tagline below

## Design Details
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- No backend needed — purely frontend
- Dark theme throughout (#0a0a0a / near-black background)
- Clean sans-serif typography
